# Week 1 English Homework - 20 March

The next text to read is 'The Necklace' by Guy de Maupassant. It is also a shorter story, though a little longer than 'The Gift of the Magi' You can find the text [here](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/the_diamond_necklace.pdf). Let me know if you have any problems opening it.

If the children can read this ahead of our next lesson, that would be great.

### Task

For this week's lesson, I ask the following;

1. Please read the story.

2. Prepare a single paragraph (or 2 is fine) summary of the story. It should be written using correct grammar and punctuation.
