# Week 4 English Homeword - 10 April

A few questions for the students to complete over the next week, as well as reading the second half of the novella as discussed.

I have attached a [document](Genres,%20Themes%20and%20Techniques.pdf) which shows the 'genres, themes and literary techniques' that we have been discussing. Have a look at it, as we'll be adding to it each week.

### Task

1. Briefly describe what is meant by 'Gothic'

2. What is a 'metaphor'?

3. What is 'Satire'?

4. What is 'Pathetic Fallacy'?

5. Over the week, as you read or watch TV, look out for when 'pathetic fallacy' is used, and give me one example (if you don't see it then you can disregard this question)

6. List some of the words from the second half of the story that you don't understand
