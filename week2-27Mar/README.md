# Week 2 English Homework - 27 March

There is no new text to read, but it may help to revisit the [story](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/the_diamond_necklace.pdf) again in order to answer the questions.

### Task

1. Please explain what is meant by 'foreshadowing' in a story
What does the word 'pride' mean?

2. How does the theme of 'pride' come through in this story?

3. Write your own short story. It can be about whatever you choose, and should be no more than two pages. I'm not really too bothered about length, it's about quality. The two things that should be included are 1) a plot twist - wherever in the story you wish, and 2) some element of foreshadowing that gives a clue, or clues, that there may be a twist. Please take care with your grammar and punctuation.
