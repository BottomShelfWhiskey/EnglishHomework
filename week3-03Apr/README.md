# Week 3 English Homework - 03 April

Next we will read 'The Canterville Ghost' by the great Oscar Wilde.

It can be viewed [here](https://www.wilde-online.info/the-canterville-ghost.html)

Please can the students read chapters 1-4 (this should take them to page 11 of the story I believe)
If they want to read it all, that is absolutely fine.
