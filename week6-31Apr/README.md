# Week 5 English Homework - 31 April

I need the students to answer some questions about the [story](TreasureInTheForest.pdf), which link back to what we were talking about in today's lesson.

There is also an additional [worksheet](Punctuation%20exercise.pdf) called 'Punctuation Exercise', which is going to test and assess the student's ability to correctly punctuate a passage of text from this story.
